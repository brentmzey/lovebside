# NEVER commit these to code!
# Use environment variables
```

- **Privacy Policy** - Required by App Store & Play Store
- **Terms of Service** - Required by App Store & Play Store

**These MUST be created before submitting to stores!**

### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
APP_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=<your-generated-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your-generated-secret>
POCKETBASE_URL=<your-production-pocketbase-url>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 4. HTTPS
- **Required for production**
