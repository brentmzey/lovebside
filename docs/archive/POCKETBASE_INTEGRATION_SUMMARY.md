# B-Side PocketBase Integration - Session Summary

**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Integration Testing  
**Time to Start Testing**: ~15 minutes

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

You were absolutely right to be concerned about PocketBase integration! We've proactively identified and documented all potential issues **before** they become problems.

### 1. ✅ Downloaded PocketBase (v0.30.4)
- Correct version for macOS ARM64 (M1/M2)
- Installed and verified working
- Located at: `/Users/brentzey/bside/pocketbase/pocketbase`

### 2. ✅ Analyzed Complete Architecture
- Verified 3-tier security (Client → API → Database)
- Confirmed all clients use `InternalApiClient` (secure!)
- Validated server uses `PocketBaseClient` (correct!)
- Checked model mappings (API ↔ Domain ↔ Database)

### 3. ✅ Created Comprehensive Documentation

#### **POCKETBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** (Complete Setup)
- Step-by-step collection creation (7 collections)
- Exact field configurations with validation rules
- API rules for each collection (copy-paste ready)
- Index definitions for performance
- Seed data templates
- Integration testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security checklist

#### **POCKETBASE_QUICK_REF.md** (Cheat Sheet)
- Quick commands
- Common issues & solutions
- Test curl commands
- Schema verification
- Security checklist

#### **diagnose-pocketbase.sh** (Automated Testing)
- Checks PocketBase running
- Verifies all collections exist
- Validates schemas match
- Tests API rules configured
- Checks seed data present
- Tests user registration flow
- Tests authentication
- Tests protected endpoints
- Provides clear error messages

### 4. ✅ Identified Potential Issues

We found and documented these potential gotchas:

#### **Schema Issues to Watch**
1. **Field naming consistency**: `userId` vs `user_id`
2. **Relation field configuration**: Must point to correct collections
3. **Unique constraints**: Compound indexes need exact setup
4. **Data type mapping**: Date formats, JSON serialization
5. **Cascade deletes**: Must be configured on relations

#### **Permission Issues to Watch**
1. **API rules syntax**: Must use exact PocketBase filter syntax
2. **Authentication context**: `@request.auth.id` availability
3. **Public vs private data**: Some collections are public read
4. **Admin operations**: Some endpoints are admin-only
5. **Match visibility**: Both users need to see their matches

#### **Integration Issues to Watch**
1. **Port conflicts**: PocketBase on 8090, Server on 8080
2. **CORS configuration**: Need proper setup for web clients
3. **Token handling**: JWT expiration and refresh
4. **Error propagation**: Server → Client error mapping
5. **Connection pooling**: PocketBase client configuration

## 🚀 How to Start Testing (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Start Services (2 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start PocketBase
cd pocketbase
./pocketbase serve
# Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/

# Terminal 2: Start Server
cd /Users/brentzey/bside
./gradlew :server:run
# API: http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 2: Create Collections (15 minutes)

Follow **POCKETBASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Open PocketBase admin UI and:

1. Create 7 collections (s_profiles, s_key_values, etc.)
2. Configure fields for each (exact specifications provided)
3. Set API rules (copy-paste from guide)
4. Create indexes (listed in guide)

**Shortcut**: Use the guide's "Manual Setup" section - it has everything formatted for copy-paste.

### Step 3: Run Diagnostic (1 minute)

```bash
# Terminal 3: Run diagnostics
./diagnose-pocketbase.sh
```

This will:
- ✓ Check all connections
- ✓ Verify schema correctness
- ✓ Test registration flow
- ✓ Test authentication
- ✓ Test protected endpoints
- ✓ Identify any issues

## 🐛 Issue Prevention Strategy

We've proactively handled these:

### 1. **Field Mismatch Prevention**
- ✅ Documented exact field names in schema
- ✅ Model classes match PocketBase structure
- ✅ Serialization names verified

### 2. **Permission Issues Prevention**
- ✅ All API rules documented with exact syntax
- ✅ Each collection has role-based rules
- ✅ Public vs private data clearly marked

### 3. **Integration Issues Prevention**
- ✅ Diagnostic script catches common issues
- ✅ Step-by-step setup reduces errors
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide for quick fixes

### 4. **Data Type Issues Prevention**
- ✅ Date/DateTime format specifications
- ✅ Number type specifications (Int vs Double)
- ✅ JSON field handling documented

### 5. **Relationship Issues Prevention**
- ✅ All relations documented with collection IDs
- ✅ Cascade delete rules specified
- ✅ Foreign key constraints noted

## 📊 Architecture Validation Results

### ✅ Security Architecture
```
Clients (Android/iOS/Web/Desktop)
    ↓ (Uses InternalApiClient ONLY)
Internal API Server (Ktor on :8080)
    ↓ (JWT Auth, Validation, Business Logic)
PocketBase Client (Server-side ONLY)
    ↓ (HTTP API calls)
PocketBase Database (:8090)
```

**Result**: ✅ Clients CANNOT access database directly (perfect!)

### ✅ API Layer Separation
- **Clients**: Use `ApiAuthRepository`, `ApiProfileRepository`, etc.
- **Repositories**: Use `InternalApiClient`
- **Server**: Uses `PocketBaseClient`
- **Database**: Only server has credentials

**Result**: ✅ Proper separation of concerns

### ✅ Model Layer Mapping
- **Domain Models**: `User`, `Profile`, `Match` (business logic)
- **API Models**: `UserDTO`, `ProfileDTO`, `MatchDTO` (wire format)
- **DB Models**: `PBUser`, `PBProfile`, `PBMatch` (storage format)

**Result**: ✅ Clean model transformations
