# Session Handoff Document

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25 01:50 UTC  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Build System Working - Android/JVM Ready, iOS Needs Fixes  
**Issue:** Recurring TypeError in CLI tool (not project issue - see AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md)

## üéØ Current Objective

Create comprehensive build/test/deploy automation that works with `./gradlew build` and documents platform-specific workarounds.

## üìä Project Structure

```
bside/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composeApp/          # Kotlin Multiplatform app (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Shared Kotlin code across platforms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/              # Kotlin/JVM backend server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pocketbase-kt-sdk/   # Custom PocketBase SDK
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pocketbase/          # PocketBase backend (Go binary)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iosApp/              # iOS-specific wrapper
```

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Gradle Multi-Project Setup**
   - Root project: `app`
   - 4 subprojects: composeApp, shared, server, pocketbase-kt-sdk
   - Type-safe project accessors enabled
   - All subprojects compile successfully

2. **Build Tasks Available**
   - `./gradlew build` - Full build
   - `./gradlew assemble` - Assembly without tests
   - `./gradlew test` - Run all tests
   - Platform-specific builds work

3. **Runtime Components**
   - PocketBase backend running on port 8090
   - Server backend can run on port 8080
   - Android app compiles and runs
   - iOS build configured

## üöß What Needs To Be Done

### 1. Unified Build Script (`./gradlew build`)

**Goal:** One command to build everything  
**Current State:** Gradle build works for Kotlin code  
**Missing:**
- PocketBase binary management (Go-based, not Gradle)
- iOS app building (requires Xcode)
- Automated testing integration

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create `BUILD_AUTOMATION.md` documenting the full process
- [ ] Create wrapper scripts for non-Gradle components
- [ ] Document platform-specific limitations
- [ ] Integrate all automated scripts

### 2. Testing Automation

**Current State:**
- Gradle test tasks exist
- No tests written yet

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Document testing strategy in `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Add unit tests for shared code
- [ ] Add integration tests for server
- [ ] Add UI tests for composeApp

### 3. Deployment Automation

**Current State:**
- `production-deploy.sh` exists but incomplete
- Docker Compose configuration exists
- CI/CD workflow templates created

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Complete production-deploy.sh
- [ ] Test Docker deployment
- [ ] Verify CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Document deployment process

## üìù Important Files to Review

1. **Build Configuration**
   - `build.gradle.kts` - Root build file
   - `settings.gradle.kts` - Project structure
   - `composeApp/build.gradle.kts` - App configuration
   - `server/build.gradle.kts` - Backend configuration

2. **Documentation**
   - `QUICK_START.md` - Getting started guide
   - `HOW_EVERYTHING_CONNECTS.md` - Architecture overview
   - `BUILD_TEST_DEPLOY.md` - Build documentation (needs completion)

3. **Scripts**
   - `start-all.sh` - Start all services
   - `stop-all.sh` - Stop all services
   - `production-deploy.sh` - Deploy to production
   - `verify-build.sh` - Verify build setup

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **CLI TypeError (CRITICAL - READ AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md)**
   - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')`
   - Occurs in GitHub Copilot CLI tool when using file globbing patterns
   - **NOT a project issue** - CLI tool bug
   - **Solution:** Use `find` commands instead of glob patterns (see AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md)

2. **Build Issues (Project-specific)**
   - ‚úÖ FIXED: Yarn lock file updated successfully
   - ‚ùå iOS build compilation errors: Requires Xcode setup fixes (not critical)
   - ‚úÖ Android builds successfully
   - ‚úÖ JVM/Server targets build successfully
   - **Workaround:** Build Android only with `./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug`

3. **Platform Limitations**
   - iOS builds require macOS + Xcode
   - PocketBase is a standalone Go binary (not built by Gradle)
   - Some platforms require specific setup

## üîß Workarounds Implemented

**See AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md for complete workaround guide**

1. **Build File Discovery:** Use `find . -name "*.gradle.kts"` instead of `*.gradle.kts`
2. **Task Listing:** Use `./gradlew tasks --group="build"` for specific groups
3. **Project Structure:** Use `./gradlew projects` to see subprojects
4. **File Listing:** Use `find` or `ls | head` with limited output
5. **Command Fallbacks:** Always add `|| echo "message"` to prevent errors

## üìã Next Session Action Plan

### Immediate Tasks (10 min)
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Yarn lock fixed with `./gradlew kotlinUpgradeYarnLock`
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Android build verified working
3. **Next:** Review AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md to prevent session crashes

### Short-term Tasks (2-3 hours)
1. Debug iOS compilation errors (check Xcode configuration)
2. Add basic unit tests for shared code
3. Complete production-deploy.sh
4. Verify Docker deployment works
5. Test CI/CD workflows locally

### Medium-term Tasks (1 day)
1. Write comprehensive testing guide
2. Add integration tests
3. Document platform-specific build processes
4. Create automated verification script

## üí° Key Commands

```bash

./master-build.sh                # Full build with tests
./master-build.sh --skip-tests   # Build without tests (faster)
./master-build.sh --quick        # Quickest build

# Direct Gradle commands
./gradlew build                  # Build everything (Kotlin/JVM)
./gradlew test                   # Run all tests
./gradlew assemble               # Build without tests

# Service management
./start-all.sh                   # Start development environment
./stop-all.sh                    # Stop all services

# Deployment
./production-deploy.sh           # Deploy to production

# Verification
./verify-build.sh                # Verify build setup

# Gradle info
./gradlew tasks --all            # List all tasks
./gradlew :composeApp:tasks      # List specific project tasks
```

## üìû Context for Next Session

You're working on a Kotlin Multiplatform project with:
- Android, iOS, Desktop, Web targets
- PocketBase backend (Go binary, port 8090)
- Kotlin/JVM server (port 8080)
- Custom PocketBase SDK

The goal is to create a seamless build/test/deploy experience while documenting platform-specific limitations. Don't try to force everything into Gradle if it doesn't make sense - document the proper workflow instead.

The recurring TypeError is a CLI tool issue, not a project issue. Use alternative commands as shown in the workarounds section.
