## ‚ö° Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Review What Was Done
```bash
# Read the session summary (recommended)
cat SESSION_SUMMARY_JAN19_2025.md

---

## üî• Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Testing (2-3 hours)
**Best if you want to ensure quality**

1. Write validation tests
   ```bash
   # Create test file
   touch shared/src/commonTest/kotlin/love/bside/app/validation/RequestValidatorsTest.kt
   
   # Copy test template from SESSION_SUMMARY_JAN19_2025.md
   # or write tests from scratch
   ```

2. Run tests
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :shared:commonTest
   ```

3. Fix any issues found

**Expected outcome**: 60+ passing tests, high confidence in validators

---

### Option B: Integration (2-3 hours)
**Best if you want to see it working**

1. Add validators to server routes
   ```kotlin
   // In AuthRoutes.kt
   post("/register") {
       val request = call.receive<RegisterRequest>()
       
       // Add this validation
       RequestValidators.validateRegistration(
           request.email,
           request.password,
           request.passwordConfirm,
           request.firstName,
           request.lastName,
           request.birthDate,
           request.seeking
       ).throwOnError()
       
       // Continue with existing logic
   }
   ```

2. Test with curl
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "invalid-email",
       "password": "weak"
     }'
   
   # Should return validation error
   ```

**Expected outcome**: All routes have validation, clear error messages

---

### Option C: Schema Hardening (1-2 hours)
**Best if you want to optimize database**

1. Run schema sync checker
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:checkSchemaSync --args="check"
   ```

2. Review findings
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:checkSchemaSync --args="recommendations"
   ```

3. Add missing indexes to `SchemaDefinition.kt`

4. Update PocketBase collections (when available)

**Expected outcome**: Optimized schema, no sync issues

---

### Option D: Mock Infrastructure (3-4 hours)
**Best if you want to test without PocketBase**

1. Create `MockPocketBaseClient.kt`
   ```kotlin
   class MockPocketBaseClient : PocketBaseClient {
       private val storage = mutableMapOf<String, MutableList<Map<String, Any>>>()
       
       override suspend fun create(
           collection: String,
           data: Map<String, Any>
       ): Result<Map<String, Any>> {
           // Mock implementation
       }
       
       // ... implement other methods
   }
   ```

2. Write integration tests using mock
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `registration creates user and profile`() {
       val mockClient = MockPocketBaseClient()
       val authService = AuthService(mockClient)
       
       val result = authService.register(validRequest)
       
       assertTrue(result.isSuccess)
       // Assert user was created
       // Assert profile was created
   }
   ```

**Expected outcome**: Can test all flows without PocketBase running

## üîß Quick Reference

### Using Validators
```kotlin
import love.bside.app.core.validation.RequestValidators

// Validate single field
val result = RequestValidators.validateEmail(email)
result.throwOnError() // Throws if invalid

// Validate complete request
RequestValidators.validateRegistration(
    email, password, passwordConfirm,
    firstName, lastName, birthDate, seeking
).throwOnError()

// Or handle gracefully
when (result) {
    is ValidationResult.Valid -> proceed()
    is ValidationResult.Invalid -> handleError(result.exception)
}
```

### Running Schema Checker
```bash
# Check for issues
./gradlew :server:checkSchemaSync --args="check"

# Get recommendations
./gradlew :server:checkSchemaSync --args="recommendations"
```

### Building Project
```bash
# Quick build (skip tests)
./gradlew build -x test -x jsBrowserTest

# Just shared module
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar

# Just server
./gradlew :server:jar

# Just Android
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
```

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small**
Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one option above and complete it fully.

### 2. **Test Frequently**
After each change, run:
```bash
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar -x test
```

### 3. **Read the Docs**
All the details are in:
- `SESSION_SUMMARY_JAN19_2025.md` - What was done
- `API_VALIDATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - What to do next
- `VALIDATION_BOLSTERING_PROGRESS.md` - Current status

### 4. **Avoid PocketBase Issues**
If PocketBase won't start, don't get stuck! All validation and testing can happen without it.

### 5. **Document as You Go**
Update `VALIDATION_BOLSTERING_PROGRESS.md` with your progress.

---

## üêõ If Something Breaks

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Rebuild
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar -x test
```

### Tests Fail
```bash
# Skip tests for now
./gradlew build -x test -x jsBrowserTest

# Or run specific tests
./gradlew :shared:commonTest --tests "ValidatorsTest"
```

### Can't Find New Files
```bash
# Verify they exist
ls shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/core/validation/
ls server/src/main/kotlin/love/bside/server/schema/

# Check git status
git status

# See what changed
git diff
```

## üìû Quick Answers

**Q: Should I start PocketBase?**  
A: Only if you need to test end-to-end. All validation work can happen without it.

**Q: Which option should I pick?**  
A: Testing (Option A) gives highest confidence. Integration (Option B) shows immediate value.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Each option is 2-4 hours. Total roadmap is 12-19 hours.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Read the detailed docs. Don't try to start PocketBase if it's failing. Focus on offline work.

**Q: Can I modify the validators?**  
A: Absolutely! They're production code but can be adjusted to your needs.
