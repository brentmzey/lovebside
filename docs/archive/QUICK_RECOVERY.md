# Quick Recovery Guide - Session Crashed?

Session crashed due to CLI TypeError? Your work is saved!

## What Happened

GitHub Copilot CLI bug: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')`  
This is **NOT** a project issue.

## Files Created Last Session

- ✅ SESSION_HANDOFF.md - Context and next steps
- ✅ BUILD_AUTOMATION.md - Build docs
- ✅ AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md - How to prevent errors
- ✅ master-build.sh - Automated build script

## Current Status

Build system works! Has 2 fixable issues:
1. Yarn lock: `./gradlew kotlinUpgradeYarnLock`
2. iOS compilation (Xcode setup)

## Next Steps

```bash
# Fix yarn lock
./gradlew kotlinUpgradeYarnLock

# Test build
./gradlew build -x test

# Read docs
cat SESSION_HANDOFF.md
cat AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md
```

## Workarounds

Use these to avoid TypeError:
- Use `find` not `*.pattern`
- Pipe to `head -20` 
- Add `|| echo "fallback"`

Read AVOID_CLI_TYPEERROR.md for details.
