## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Multi-tier architecture (Client → Server → Database)
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control
- Type-safe database models
- Migration system
- RESTful API endpoints
- Android app builds
- Server builds and runs

## 🔧 Essential Commands

```bash
# Build everything
./gradlew build -x test -x jsBrowserTest

# Build specific targets
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar              # Shared JVM library
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug   # Android APK
./gradlew :server:shadowJar           # Server JAR
./gradlew :composeApp:packageDmg      # macOS app (on Mac)

# Run
./gradlew :server:run                 # Start API server
cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve   # Start database

# Test
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest             # Run tests
./gradlew test                        # All tests (may timeout)

# Clean
./gradlew clean                       # Clean build
rm -rf build */build                  # Nuclear clean
```

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check the new SDK isn't in source tree
ls shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/data/api/pocketbase_new_sdk
# Should say: "No such file or directory"

# If it exists, move it out:
mv shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/data/api/pocketbase_new_sdk \
   shared/pocketbase_new_sdk_backup_2

# Then rebuild:
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 <PID>

# Check PocketBase is running
curl http://localhost:8090/api/health
```

### Tests Fail
```bash
# Skip tests for now
./gradlew build -x test -x jsBrowserTest -x testDebugUnitTest

# Or run specific tests only
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest --tests "ProfileRepositoryTest"
```

4. Want to deploy? → Read BUILD_AND_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I use the new PocketBase SDK?**  
A: No, it's disabled. Use `PocketBaseClient.kt` instead. It works reliably.

**Q: Why are tests timing out?**  
A: Some browser tests have issues. Skip them with `-x jsBrowserTest -x test`

**Q: Can I deploy this now?**  
A: Yes! Follow BUILD_AND_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md. Server and Android are ready.

**Q: What's the priority?**  
A: Check TODO.md → "Critical" section. That's what matters for MVP.
