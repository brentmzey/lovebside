## 🎨 Design System Findings

### Current Colors (Working Great!)
- Primary: #E91E63 (Material Pink 500) - Warm, romantic
- Secondary: #6200EA (Deep Purple A700) - Thoughtful, Proust vibe
- Tertiary: #FF7043 (Deep Orange) - Energetic accents
- Dark Mode: #121212 (OLED black)

### Figma Comparison
**Status**: ✅ Strong alignment!
- Colors convey right emotions (warm + sophisticated) ✅
- Component style matches (rounded, spacious) ✅
- Material 3 throughout ✅
- Can fine-tune exact hex values later with Figma Desktop

**Recommendation**: Keep current colors! They look professional and work perfectly for a dating app.

## 🚀 Ready for Next Session

### Testing & Dev Mode Inspection
When you're ready to test:

```bash
# Run desktop app
cd /Users/brentzey/bside
./gradlew :composeApp:run --no-daemon

# What to check:
- All 4 tabs navigate properly
- Dark mode toggle works in Settings
- Mock data displays (6 profiles, 5 conversations)
- ChatDetailScreen (not wired yet, but built)
- ProfileDetailScreen (not wired yet, but built)
- Component animations (button press, elevation changes)
```

### Backend Work (Next Priority)
**Option A: Repository Layer** (6-8 hours)
- Implement AuthRepository (login, signup, token refresh)
- Implement ProfileRepository (CRUD with caching)
- Implement MessageRepository (send, receive, real-time)
- Implement MatchRepository (fetch, accept, dismiss)
- Implement ProustRepository (save/fetch answers)

All implementation details in `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (lines 100-300)

**Option B: Real-Time Messaging** (3-4 hours)
- PocketBase SSE integration (Server-Sent Events)
- Platform-specific EventSource implementations
- Optimistic message updates
- Typing indicators

Details in `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (lines 500-700)

**Option C: Continue UI** (8-10 hours)
- Edit Profile Screen
- Proust Questionnaire Flow
- Onboarding (Splash, Welcome, Login, Signup)

Details in `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (lines 50-200)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Build Issue (Fixed Tonight)
- ❌ Message model didn't exist → ✅ Created Message.kt
- ❌ ChatDetailScreen had import errors → ✅ Fixed with proper model

### Current Status
- ✅ All builds successful
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ⚠️ ChatDetailScreen needs wiring to navigation
- ⚠️ ProfileDetailScreen needs wiring to navigation

## 💡 Tips for Next Session

### Before You Start
1. Read `WHERE_WE_ARE.md` (updated with full status)
2. Check `PROGRESS.md` (shows what we did tonight)
3. Pick a track from priorities above
4. Run the app to refresh your memory

### While Working
1. **Avoid CLI crashes**: Don't use piped commands (no `| head`, `| tail`)
   - See `TYPEERROR_WORKAROUND.md` for details
2. **Keep docs updated**: Update `PROGRESS.md` as you go
3. **Build often**: `./gradlew :composeApp:compileKotlinJvm --no-daemon`
4. **Hot reload**: Enabled for faster iteration

### Testing Checklist
```
Manual Testing (30 min):
□ Run desktop app
□ Click all 4 tabs (Discovery, Messages, Profile, Settings)
□ Toggle dark mode (Settings screen)
□ Verify mock data shows (6 profiles, 5 conversations)
□ Check component animations (button press, card hover)
□ Scroll through all screens
□ Test on different window sizes

Backend Testing (when wired):
□ PocketBase running on :8090
□ Authentication flow works
□ Profile data loads
□ Messages send/receive
□ Real-time updates work
□ Cache hits logged
```

2. **Wire Navigation**: Connect ChatDetailScreen and ProfileDetailScreen
3. **Build Input Fields**: Component for forms (1 hour)

### Short-term (This Week - 8-10 hours)
1. **Complete UI**: Edit Profile, Questionnaire, Onboarding
2. **OR Backend**: Implement all repositories
3. **Test Everything**: Manual testing, fix bugs

### Medium-term (Next Week - 12-16 hours)

## 📝 Personal Notes

**Great collaboration tonight!** We:
- Built a ton of quality code
- Made smart design decisions
- Documented everything thoroughly
- Set up for easy continuation

**The app foundation is rock solid.** Colors look great, components are polished, architecture is clean. Just need to wire everything together and add the matching algorithm!

**Feel free to**:
- Test the app and explore what we built
- Pick any implementation track that interests you
- Ask questions about any code or design decisions
- Refine colors if you want (but current ones work well!)

**I'm here to help whenever you're ready to continue!** 💪
