# üö® CLI Safety Summary

## What Happened (Oct 19, 2025, 9:42 PM)

**Another TypeError crash** during documentation cleanup. CLI crashed and required force quit.

## Root Cause

Complex bash command with:
- 7+ commands chained with `&&`
- Multiple pipes to `wc -l`
- Output redirection `2>/dev/null`
- Glob patterns combined with above

## What We Learned

The CLI has a **bug that crashes on complex command chains**, especially:
1. Multiple `&&` operators (3+)
2. Pipes combined with `&&`
3. Output redirection in chains
4. Glob patterns + pipes + chains

## The Golden Rule

### üö® ONE SIMPLE COMMAND AT A TIME

**Never** combine:
- Pipes (`|`) + command chains (`&&`)
- Output redirection (`2>/dev/null`) + complex chains
- Multiple operations in a single bash call

### ‚úÖ Safe Commands
```bash
ls -1 *.md
./gradlew :composeApp:compileKotlinJvm --no-daemon
cat filename.md
git status
```

### ‚ùå Unsafe Commands (WILL CRASH)
```bash
ls *.md | wc -l && ls archive/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
find . -name "*.kt" 2>/dev/null | head -20
./gradlew build | grep -i error
```

## What Was Saved

All work before the crash was completed:

‚úÖ **Documentation organized**:
- 26 active markdown files (down from 95)
- 72+ files archived to `docs/archive/`
- Created comprehensive guides:
  - `START_HERE.md` (main entry)
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` (complete plan)
  - `WHERE_WE_ARE.md` (current status)
  - `SESSION_RECOVERY_NOTES.md` (recovery guide)

‚úÖ **UI implementation complete** (from previous session):
- 10 UI files (~1,350 lines)
- 4-tab navigation
- All screens working
- Mock data integrated
- Build successful

‚úÖ **Build verified**: Just tested, still compiling fine!

## Files to Read Now

1. **SESSION_RECOVERY_NOTES.md** ‚Üê Start here for recovery
2. **TYPEERROR_WORKAROUND.md** ‚Üê Updated with new patterns
3. **WHERE_WE_ARE.md** ‚Üê Complete current status
4. **START_HERE.md** ‚Üê Project overview

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ‚úÖ Build verified working
2. Read recovery notes
3. Review documentation structure
4. Continue with planned work

### This Week
1. Extract Figma colors (1 hour)
2. Update theme with brand (30 min)
3. Add logo to screens (30 min)
4. Fix Android build (10 min)

### Next Week
1. Verify PocketBase setup
2. Wire authentication
3. Connect real data
4. Build remaining UI screens

## Key Takeaway

**The CLI bug is avoidable** by following simple command patterns. Updated guidance is now in `TYPEERROR_WORKAROUND.md` with specific patterns to avoid.

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Everything saved, build working, ready to continue!

**Documentation**: 4 key files created with complete roadmap and recovery plan.

**Next action**: Read WHERE_WE_ARE.md and pick up where we left off (UI polish or backend setup).
