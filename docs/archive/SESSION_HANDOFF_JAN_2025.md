# Session Handoff - January 17, 2025

**Session Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Status**: ✅ Build Working for Core Targets  
**Priority**: Continue with enterprise features

---

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Build Restored ✅
- **Problem**: New PocketBase SDK causing multiplatform compilation issues
- **Solution**: Moved SDK out of source tree temporarily
- **Result**: Android, Server, JVM, and shared module compile successfully

### 2. Issue Diagnosed ✅
- Identified Kotlin multiplatform inline function restrictions
- Documented all compilation issues and attempted fixes
- Created backup of SDK work at `shared/pocketbase_new_sdk_backup/`

### 3. Documentation Enhanced ✅
- Created `CURRENT_STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md` (comprehensive status doc)
- Updated with current build status
- Added decision matrix for SDK approach

---

## ✅ Current Working Build

```bash
# These targets build successfully:
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar              # ✅ Success
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug   # ✅ Success  
./gradlew :server:jar                 # ✅ Success
```

### Build Times
- Shared module (JVM): ~5-10 seconds
- Android app: ~10-15 seconds
- Server: ~3-5 seconds
- **Total incremental build**: ~20-30 seconds

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### 1. New PocketBase SDK Disabled
**Location**: `shared/pocketbase_new_sdk_backup/`

**Issues**:
- Inline functions with local `@Serializable` classes
- Type inference problems with generic inline functions
- Iterator ambiguity in inline function lambdas

**Options Forward**:
1. **Recommended**: Use existing `PocketBaseClient.kt` (simple, works)
2. Refactor SDK to remove all inline/reified
3. Use expect/actual pattern for platform-specific implementations
4. Revisit when time permits

### 2. Some Tests Failing
- JS browser tests timing out
- Some unit tests need updating
- Not blocking main development

### 3. iOS Build Not Tested
- Should work now that SDK is removed
- Needs verification on macOS with Xcode

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Verify Full Build (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test all targets
./gradlew :shared:jvmJar
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug  
./gradlew :server:jar

# If on macOS with Xcode:
./gradlew :composeApp:iosX64MainKlibrary
```

### 2. Run Integration Tests (30 minutes)
```bash
# Start PocketBase
cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve

# Start server (in another terminal)
./gradlew :server:run

# Run tests
./gradlew :shared:jvmTest

# Test API manually
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

### 3. Implement Missing Enterprise Features (4-6 hours)

**A. Migration Generator (2 hours)**
```bash
# Create new task
./gradlew :server:generateMigration
```

**Features**:
- Compare current DB schema with models
- Generate migration files automatically
- Apply migrations safely

**B. Request Validation (1 hour)**
- Add validation to all endpoints
- Return clear error messages
- Validate email format, password strength, etc.

**C. Rate Limiting (1 hour)**
- Implement rate limiting middleware  
- Configure limits per endpoint
- Return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded

**D. Audit Logging (1-2 hours)**
- Log all data changes
- Track who changed what and when
- Queryable audit trail

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "PocketBase" errors
```bash
# The new SDK is disabled, make sure it's moved:
ls shared/pocketbase_new_sdk_backup/  # Should exist
ls shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/data/api/pocketbase_new_sdk/  # Should NOT exist

# If it exists, move it:
mv shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/data/api/pocketbase_new_sdk \
   shared/pocketbase_new_sdk_backup2
```

### Tests Timeout
```bash
# Skip tests during build:
./gradlew build -x test -x jsBrowserTest -x testDebugUnitTest -x testReleaseUnitTest
```

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check PocketBase is running
curl http://localhost:8090/api/health

# Check ports are available
lsof -i :8080  # Server port
lsof -i :8090  # PocketBase port

# View server logs
./gradlew :server:run --info
```

### iOS Build Issues (if applicable)
```bash
# Clean iOS build
cd iosApp
xcodebuild clean

# Or delete derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# Rebuild framework
cd .. && ./gradlew :shared:linkDebugFrameworkIosArm64
```

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Next Session

**If You Have 1 Hour:**
1. Verify full build on all platforms
2. Run integration tests
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Update TODO.md with progress

**If You Have 2-3 Hours:**
1. Do above
2. Implement request validation
3. Add rate limiting
4. Write tests for new features

**If You Have 4+ Hours:**
1. Do above
2. Implement migration generator
3. Add audit logging
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Set up monitoring

### Technology Decisions

**Use PocketBaseClient.kt** (not the new SDK)
- It works reliably
- Simpler code
- Easier to maintain
- Can revisit complex SDK later

**Focus on Features Over Perfection**
- Get MVP working end-to-end
- Add features incrementally
- Test frequently
- Refactor later if needed

**Deployment Strategy**
- Start with staging environment
- Use Docker for consistency
- Set up CI/CD early
- Monitor from day one

## 🎓 Lessons from This Session

### Kotlin Multiplatform Challenges
1. **Inline functions are tricky**: Lots of restrictions on what you can do inside them
2. **Type inference differs by platform**: What works on JVM may not work on Native
3. **Reified generics have limits**: Can't be used with certain patterns
4. **Platform-specific code helps**: Use expect/actual when needed

### Best Practices Learned
1. **Start simple, add complexity later**: Don't over-engineer early
2. **Test on all platforms frequently**: Catch issues early
3. **Keep working builds**: Don't break the build for too long
4. **Document as you go**: Future you will be grateful

### What Worked Well
1. **Modular architecture**: Easy to isolate and fix issues
2. **Good documentation**: Easy to understand what's going on
3. **Incremental approach**: Small changes, test often
4. **Having backups**: Easy to revert when needed
