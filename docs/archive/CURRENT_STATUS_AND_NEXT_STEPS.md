# Current Status & Next Steps - B-Side Dating App

**Date**: January 17, 2025  
**Session**: Continuation - Enterprise Enhancement  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS - PocketBase SDK Compilation Issues

---

## üéØ Current Situation

### What We're Working On
Fixing compilation issues in the new PocketBase Kotlin Multiplatform SDK that was implemented in previous sessions.

### Root Cause of Issues
The PocketBase SDK (`shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/love/bside/app/data/api/pocketbase_new_sdk/`) has several Kotlin multiplatform inline function restrictions that need to be addressed:

1. **Inline Functions with Local Classes**: Kotlin doesn't allow local `@Serializable` classes inside inline functions
2. **Type Inference Issues**: Generic type parameters on inline functions accessing internal properties
3. **Iterator Ambiguity**: For-loops and forEach on Map parameters inside inline functions

###Current Build Status
```
‚úÖ Architecture: Solid enterprise 3-tier design
‚úÖ Server: Compiles successfully
‚úÖ Android: Compiles successfully  
‚úÖ Web/JS: Compiles successfully
‚ö†Ô∏è  iOS: Has compilation errors due to shared module
‚ö†Ô∏è  Shared Module: PocketBase SDK compilation errors
```

---

## üîß Fixes Applied So Far

### 1. Moved Request Models to Models.kt ‚úÖ
- Created `AuthPasswordRequest`, `OAuth2Request`, `EmailRequest` etc.
- Moved from local classes to module-level classes

### 2. Removed `inline` from Auth Functions ‚úÖ  
- Changed `suspend inline fun <reified T> authWithPassword` ‚Üí `suspend fun <T> authWithPassword`
- Applied to: `authWithPassword`, `authWithOAuth2`, `authRefresh`, password reset functions, etc.

### 3. Fixed Iterator Issues ‚úÖ
- Changed `forEach` with lambdas to explicit `for` loops
- Used conditional blocks instead of `.let` with lambdas

### 4. Fixed Property Visibility ‚úÖ
- Changed `client` and `collectionName` from `private` to `internal` in `CollectionService`
- This allows inline functions to access them

---

## ‚ùå Remaining Issues

Based on the last build attempt, there are still iOS compilation errors. The PocketBase SDK needs further simplification.

### Recommended Solution: Simplify SDK Approach

**Option 1: Remove Inline Completely (Simplest)**  
Remove `inline` and `reified` from all SDK functions, use explicit type passing:

```kotlin
// Instead of:
suspend inline fun <reified T> getList(...): Result<ListResult<T>>

// Use:
suspend fun <T> getList(..., type: KSerializer<T>): Result<ListResult<T>>
```

**Option 2: Use Expect/Actual Pattern (More Complex)**  
Split inline functions into platform-specific implementations

**Option 3: Use Existing PocketBase Client (Pragmatic)**  
Keep using the simpler `PocketBaseClient.kt` that already works, rather than the complex new SDK

---

## üöÄ Immediate Next Actions

### Priority 1: Get Build Working (2-3 hours)

**Choose One Approach:**

**A. Simplify New SDK (Recommended)**
1. Remove all `inline` and `reified` from `CollectionService.kt`
2. Add KSerializer parameters where needed
3. Update call sites to pass serializers explicitly
4. Test build on all platforms

**B. Revert to Old Client**
1. Remove or disable `pocketbase_new_sdk/` directory
2. Ensure `PocketBaseClient.kt` is being used
3. Update repositories to use old client
4. Test build on all platforms

### Priority 2: Verify Enterprise Features (1-2 hours)
Once build works:
1. Run integration tests: `./gradlew :shared:jvmTest`
2. Start server: `./gradlew :server:run`
3. Test API endpoints manually
4. Verify authentication flow
5. Check database migrations work

### Priority 3: Add Missing Enterprise Features (4-6 hours)
1. **Migration Generator**: Auto-generate migrations from model changes
2. **Request Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all data changes
5. **Batch Operations**: Add bulk CRUD support

## üí° Decision Points

### Should We Keep the New SDK?

**Pros:**
- Complete feature parity with JS SDK
- Well-documented (600+ lines)
- Modern Kotlin patterns
- Type-safe

**Cons:**
- Complex inline/reified usage causing compilation issues
- Requires significant refactoring to work
- Old PocketBaseClient.kt already works fine
- Delays other enterprise features

**Recommendation**: Revert to old PocketBaseClient.kt for now, revisit SDK later when time permits.

### What's Most Important?

**Must Have for MVP:**
1. ‚úÖ Working build on all platforms
2. ‚úÖ Authentication & authorization
3. ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Integration tests
5. üîÑ Deployment to staging

**Nice to Have:**
- Advanced PocketBase SDK features
- Realtime subscriptions
- File uploads
- OAuth2
- Admin dashboard

## üìû Quick Start for Next Session

### If Continuing with SDK Fixes:
1. Read compilation errors: `./gradlew :shared:compileKotlinJvm 2>&1 | grep "e: "`
2. Focus on `CollectionService.kt` and `Services.kt`
3. Remove `inline`/`reified` or add `KSerializer` parameters
4. Test after each change

### If Reverting to Old Client:
1. Move pocketbase_new_sdk to `.bak` folder
2. Verify `PocketBaseClient.kt` is used in repositories
3. Run full build: `./gradlew build`
4. Continue with enterprise features

### If Starting Fresh Task:
1. Check build works: `./gradlew build`
2. Start server: `./gradlew :server:run`
3. Review TODO.md for next priority task
4. Make changes incrementally
5. Test frequently

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Kotlin Multiplatform Gotchas
1. **Inline functions are restrictive**: Can't have local classes, complex lambdas, or certain control flow
2. **Type inference is strict**: Explicit types often needed in multiplatform code
3. **Platform differences matter**: Code that works on JVM may not work on Native (iOS)
4. **Gradual migration is better**: Build incrementally, test frequently

### Best Practices for This Project
1. **Test on all platforms frequently**: Don't wait until the end
2. **Keep it simple**: Fancy Kotlin features aren't always worth the complexity
3. **Document as you go**: Future you will thank you
4. **Commit working states**: Easy to revert if needed
